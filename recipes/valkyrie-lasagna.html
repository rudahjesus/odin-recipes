        <ol>
            <li>Place steak into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until steak is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred steak with two tridents (forks wont be enough).</li>
            <li>Combine god sauce and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded steak; simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the steak. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the Jormungand mixture and cheese at will</li>
            <li>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>It's done! Enjoy the Valkyries's own recipe!</li>
